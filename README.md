### Answer to Task 1. Visual design
The “total sales” pie chart gives an idea of how much the total sales for each category is, but it doesn’t provide any numbers that would make it even more informative. Therefore, it should have numbers in currency or percentages to make it clear how much the items in each category have sold. Also, a pie chart can be useful when illustrating a maximum of two different categories, but if it is more than that it would be better to use different plots, such as the Treemap plot. In addition, it is hard to see how much each of the slices of the pie chart represents of the total amount because of the angles of the slices.
The “My analysis” bubble chart is a bit unclear in the sense that the decimals don’t indicate any format. Does it try to conceptualize the average discount in percentages or in some currency? Also, it should have percentages or integers instead of decimals to make it clearer. Furthermore, the regions should be modified. Now it is a mix of individual countries, such as Canada and larger regions such as EMEA which consists of multiple countries. There are also regions that leaves one guessing, such as the “ South” and “West” regions. It is hard to say which southern and western regions the chart tries to highlight. Therefore, the regions should be clearly indicated, for example by larger regions such as EMEA, Asia, North America etc.
The ”profit by country” should use other color combinations such as blue–green instead of red-green because many people might have color deficiency. Also, one might consider using a different chart type to represent the profit by country, since maps can sometimes get confusing. For instance, using a simple bar plot might be more simple option to represent quantities.
